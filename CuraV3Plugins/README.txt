I originally wrote a plugin for Cura 15+ to add GCode lines to every print, showing the "percentage complete" as the print progressed.  That code can be found in ../scripts/CuraPlugin_AddPctComplete.py.

The plugin framework totally changed in Cura v2 and v3 (which are newer than V15).  So I had to write it again.
